My Name is Ronald Moore and I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Emory University.
I am interested in developing machine learning models to promote fairer and more equitable treatment in healthcare. My current academic research focuses on developing risk prediction models and recommender systems using active learning, domain adaptation, online learning, and reinforcement learning algorithms. I also have industry experience conducting research with state-of-the-art computer vision models and graph neural networks.
